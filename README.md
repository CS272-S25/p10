# CS472 Group Project 
Group 10: Ulises, Sam, & Jack

**NOTE TO GROUP: app.js line 259 is commented out for testing checkout form.**

TODO:
1. ~~Make sure localStorage (cart) is not cleared until detail confirmation.~~
2. ~~Don't allow checkout without items in cart.~~
3. ~~Don't allow checkout confirmation without missing fields.~~
4. Finish formatting input form.
5. ~~Make inputting apartment/suite number optional~~


Other work:
1. Show order details in order.html (order saved in localStorage).
    - Currently only showing order items, need user info.
2. Add functionality for editing product quanitity.
3. Make inputting state required if the country is the U.S., and optional otherwise
4. Make sure inputs follow the given format (card number takes 16 numbers, etc.)
    - The checkout form should be using form-control (bootstrap classes).


Note to instructor: I had the wrong email set in my Git config so my old 
commits don't show under 'hgzlz2' contributor. -Ulises
