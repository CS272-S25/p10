# CS472 Group Project 
Group 10: Ulises, Sam, & Jack

TODO:
1. ~~Make sure localStorage (cart) is not cleared until detail confirmation.~~
2. ~~Don't allow checkout without items in cart.~~
3. ~~Don't allow checkout confirmation without missing fields.~~
4. Format input form.
5. Make inputting apartment/suite number optional

Other ideas:
1. Show order details in order.html (order saved in localStorage).
2. Add functionality for editing product quanitity.
3. Make inputting state required if the country is the U.S., and optional otherwise
4. Make sure inputs follow the given format (card numbers follow the xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx format, etc.)


Note to instructor: I had the wrong email set in my Git config so my old commits don't show under 'hgzlz2' contributor. -Ulises
